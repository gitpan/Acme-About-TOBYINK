NAME
    Acme::About::TOBYINK - about Toby Inkster on CPAN

DESCRIPTION
  Bug Reports
    Please use <http://rt.cpan.org/> for reporting any bugs in my modules.

  Versioning
    Most of my releases use M.NNN versioning where M is the major version
    and NNN is a three digit minor version. When M is 0, do not expect too
    much API stability. Once M reaches 1, then expect the API to be
    reasonably stable until M reaches 2. Big jumps in the minor version are
    used to signal largish changes, albeit with a roughly compatible API.

    This release is an exception - it uses a date-based version.

    I generally follow a "release early, release often" policy. Expect the
    early versions of a release to be barely functional proofs of concept.

  Coding Style
    I tend to write using something approximating the Allman style
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style>, using tabs for
    indentation <http://www.derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html>.

  Compatibility
    As of 10 October 2011, all my releases will target Perl 5.10, except:

    *   Build Toolchain

        My Module::Install/Module::Package-related releases target Perl 5.8.

    *   OO Framework

        This includes Object::Role, Object::AUTHORITY, Object::DOES,
        Object::Tap and some related modules target Perl 5.6.

    From July 2012, all my new releases will target Perl 5.12. Existing
    releases will move to 5.12 if/when I see an advantage to it.

  Packaging Conventions
    As of October 2011, all my releases use Module::Package::RDF for
    packaging.
